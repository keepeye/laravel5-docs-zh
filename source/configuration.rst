 ## Introduction

All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in
the ``config`` directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to
look through the files and get familiar with the options available to
you.

 ## After Installation

Naming Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing Laravel, you may wish to "name" your application. By
default, the ``app`` directory is namespaced under ``App``, and
autoloaded by Composer using the `PSR-4 autoloading
standard <http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/>`__. However, you may change
the namespace to match the name of your application, which you can
easily do via the ``app:name`` Artisan command.

For example, if your application is named "Horsefly", you could run the
following command from the root of your installation:

::

    php artisan app:name Horsefly

Renaming your application is entirely optional, and you are free to keep
the ``App`` namespace if you wish.

Other Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel needs very little configuration out of the box. You are free to
get started developing! However, you may wish to review the
``config/app.php`` file and its documentation. It contains several
options such as ``timezone`` and ``locale`` that you may wish to change
according to your location.

Once Laravel is installed, you should also `configure your local
environment </docs/5.0/configuration#environment-configuration>`__.

    **Note:** You should never have the ``app.debug`` configuration
    option set to ``true`` for a production application.

 ### Permissions

Laravel may require one set of permissions to be configured: folders
within ``storage`` require write access by the web server.

 ## Accessing Configuration Values

You may easily access your configuration values using the ``Config``
facade:

::

    $value = Config::get('app.timezone');

    Config::set('app.timezone', 'America/Chicago');

You may also use the ``config`` helper function:

::

    $value = config('app.timezone');

 ## Environment Configuration

It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the
environment the application is running in. For example, you may wish to
use a different cache driver locally than you do on your production
server. It's easy using environment based configuration.

To make this a cinch, Laravel utilizes the
`DotEnv <https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv>`__ PHP library by Vance
Lucas. In a fresh Laravel installation, the root directory of your
application will contain a ``.env.example`` file. If you install Laravel
via Composer, this file will automatically be renamed to ``.env``.
Otherwise, you should rename the file manually.

All of the variables listed in this file will be loaded into the
``$_ENV`` PHP super-global when your application receives a request. You
may use the ``env`` helper to retrieve values from these variables. In
fact, if you review the Laravel configuration files, you will notice
several of the options already using this helper!

Feel free to modify your environment variables as needed for your own
local server, as well as your production environment. However, your
``.env`` file should not be committed to your application's source
control, since each developer / server using your application could
require a different environment configuration.

If you are developing with a team, you may wish to continue including a
``.env.example`` file with your application. By putting place-holder
values in the example configuration file, other developers on your team
can clearly see which environment variables are needed to run your
application.

Accessing The Current Application Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may access the current application environment via the
``environment`` method on the ``Application`` instance:

::

    $environment = $app->environment();

You may also pass arguments to the ``environment`` method to check if
the environment matches a given value:

::

    if ($app->environment('local'))
    {
        // The environment is local
    }

    if ($app->environment('local', 'staging'))
    {
        // The environment is either local OR staging...
    }

To obtain an instance of the application, resolve the
``Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application`` contract via the
`service container </docs/5.0/container>`__. Of course, if you are
within a `service provider </docs/5.0/providers>`__, the application
instance is available via the ``$this->app`` instance variable.

An application instance may also be accessed via the ``app`` helper of
the ``App`` facade:

::

    $environment = app()->environment();

    $environment = App::environment();

 ## Configuration Caching

To give your application a little speed boost, you may cache all of your
configuration files into a single file using the ``config:cache``
Artisan command. This will combine all of the configuration options for
your application into a single file which can be loaded quickly by the
framework.

You should typically run the ``config:cache`` command as part of your
deployment routine.

 ## Maintenance Mode

When your application is in maintenance mode, a custom view will be
displayed for all requests into your application. This makes it easy to
"disable" your application while it is updating or when you are
performing maintenance. A maintenance mode check is included in the
default middleware stack for your application. If the application is in
maintenance mode, an ``HttpException`` will be thrown with a status code
of 503.

To enable maintenance mode, simply execute the ``down`` Artisan command:

::

    php artisan down

To disable maintenance mode, use the ``up`` command:

::

    php artisan up

Maintenance Mode Response Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default template for maintenance mode responses is located in
``resources/views/errors/503.blade.php``.

Maintenance Mode & Queues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While your application is in maintenance mode, no `queued
jobs </docs/5.0/queues>`__ will be handled. The jobs will continue to be
handled as normal once the application is out of maintenance mode.

 ## Pretty URLs

Apache
~~~~~~

The framework ships with a ``public/.htaccess`` file that is used to
allow URLs without ``index.php``. If you use Apache to serve your
Laravel application, be sure to enable the ``mod_rewrite`` module.

If the ``.htaccess`` file that ships with Laravel does not work with
your Apache installation, try this one:

::

    Options +FollowSymLinks
    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]

Nginx
~~~~~

On Nginx, the following directive in your site configuration will allow
"pretty" URLs:

::

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

Of course, when using `Homestead </docs/5.0/homestead>`__, pretty URLs
will be configured automatically.
