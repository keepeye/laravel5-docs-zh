 ## Introduction

Laravel strives to make the entire PHP development experience
delightful, including your local development environment.
`Vagrant <http://vagrantup.com>`__ provides a simple, elegant way to
manage and provision Virtual Machines.

Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant "box" that
provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you
to install PHP, HHVM, a web server, and any other server software on
your local machine. No more worrying about messing up your operating
system! Vagrant boxes are completely disposable. If something goes
wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes!

Homestead runs on any Windows, Mac, or Linux system, and includes the
Nginx web server, PHP 5.6, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, and all of
the other goodies you need to develop amazing Laravel applications.

    **Note:** If you are using Windows, you may need to enable hardware
    virtualization (VT-x). It can usually be enabled via your BIOS.

Homestead is currently built and tested using Vagrant 1.6.

 ## Installation & Setup

Installing VirtualBox & Vagrant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before launching your Homestead environment, you must install
`VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`__ and
`Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`__. Both of these
software packages provide easy-to-use visual installers for all popular
operating systems.

Adding The Vagrant Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once VirtualBox and Vagrant have been installed, you should add the
``laravel/homestead`` box to your Vagrant installation using the
following command in your terminal. It will take a few minutes to
download the box, depending on your Internet connection speed:

::

    vagrant box add laravel/homestead

Installing Homestead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manually Via Git (No Local PHP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, if you do not want to install PHP on your local machine,
you may install Homestead manually by simply cloning the repository.
Consider cloning the repository into a ``Homestead`` folder within your
"home" directory, as the Homestead box will serve as the host to all of
your Laravel (and PHP) projects:

::

    git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git Homestead

Once you have installed the Homestead CLI tool, run the ``bash init.sh``
command to create the ``Homestead.yaml`` configuration file:

::

    bash init.sh

The ``Homestead.yaml`` file will be placed in your ``~/.homestead``
directory.

With Composer + PHP Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the box has been added to your Vagrant installation, you are ready
to install the Homestead CLI tool using the Composer ``global`` command:

::

    composer global require "laravel/homestead=~2.0"

Make sure to place the ``~/.composer/vendor/bin`` directory in your PATH
so the ``homestead`` executable is found when you run the ``homestead``
command in your terminal.

Once you have installed the Homestead CLI tool, run the ``init`` command
to create the ``Homestead.yaml`` configuration file:

::

    homestead init

The ``Homestead.yaml`` file will be placed in the ``~/.homestead``
directory. If you're using a Mac or Linux system, you may edit
``Homestead.yaml`` file by running the ``homestead edit`` command in
your terminal:

::

    homestead edit

Set Your SSH Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, you should edit the ``Homestead.yaml`` file. In this file, you can
configure the path to your public SSH key, as well as the folders you
wish to be shared between your main machine and the Homestead virtual
machine.

Don't have an SSH key? On Mac and Linux, you can generally create an SSH
key pair using the following command:

::

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "you@homestead"

On Windows, you may install `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`__ and use the
``Git Bash`` shell included with Git to issue the command above.
Alternatively, you may use
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>`__
and
`PuTTYgen <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>`__.

Once you have created a SSH key, specify the key's path in the
``authorize`` property of your ``Homestead.yaml`` file.

Configure Your Shared Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``folders`` property of the ``Homestead.yaml`` file lists all of the
folders you wish to share with your Homestead environment. As files
within these folders are changed, they will be kept in sync between your
local machine and the Homestead environment. You may configure as many
shared folders as necessary!

Configure Your Nginx Sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not familiar with Nginx? No problem. The ``sites`` property allows you
to easily map a "domain" to a folder on your Homestead environment. A
sample site configuration is included in the ``Homestead.yaml`` file.
Again, you may add as many sites to your Homestead environment as
necessary. Homestead can serve as a convenient, virtualized environment
for every Laravel project you are working on!

You can make any Homestead site use `HHVM <http://hhvm.com>`__ by
setting the ``hhvm`` option to ``true``:

::

    sites:
        - map: homestead.app
          to: /home/vagrant/Code/Laravel/public
          hhvm: true

Bash Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add Bash aliases to your Homestead box, simply add to the ``aliases``
file in the root of the ``~/.homestead`` directory.

Launch The Vagrant Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have edited the ``Homestead.yaml`` to your liking, run the
``vagrant up`` command from your Homestead directory.

Vagrant will boot the virtual machine, and configure your shared folders
and Nginx sites automatically! To destroy the machine, you may use the
``vagrant destroy --force`` command.

Don't forget to add the "domains" for your Nginx sites to the ``hosts``
file on your machine! The ``hosts`` file will redirect your requests for
the local domains into your Homestead environment. On Mac and Linux,
this file is located at ``/etc/hosts``. On Windows, it is located at
``C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts``. The lines you add to this
file will look like the following:

::

    192.168.10.10  homestead.app

Make sure the IP address listed is the one you set in your
``Homestead.yaml`` file. Once you have added the domain to your
``hosts`` file, you can access the site via your web browser!

::

    http://homestead.app

 ## Daily Usage

Connecting Via SSH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to your Homestead environment via SSH, issue the
``vagrant ssh`` command from your Homestead directory.

Since you will probably need to SSH into your Homestead machine
frequently, consider creating an "alias" on your host machine:

::

    alias vm="ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222"

Once you create this alias, you can simply use the "vm" command to SSH
into your Homestead machine from anywhere on your system.

Connecting To Your Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``homestead`` database is configured for both MySQL and Postgres out
of the box. For even more convenience, Laravel's ``local`` database
configuration is set to use this database by default.

To connect to your MySQL or Postgres database from your main machine via
Navicat or Sequel Pro, you should connect to ``127.0.0.1`` and port
33060 (MySQL) or 54320 (Postgres). The username and password for both
databases is ``homestead`` / ``secret``.

    **Note:** You should only use these non-standard ports when
    connecting to the databases from your main machine. You will use the
    default 3306 and 5432 ports in your Laravel database configuration
    file since Laravel is running *within* the Virtual Machine.

Adding Additional Sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your Homestead environment is provisioned and running, you may want
to add additional Nginx sites for your Laravel applications. You can run
as many Laravel installations as you wish on a single Homestead
environment. There are two ways to do this: First, you may simply add
the sites to your ``Homestead.yaml`` file and then run
``vagrant provision``.

Alternatively, you may use the ``serve`` script that is available on
your Homestead environment. To use the ``serve`` script, SSH into your
Homestead environment and run the following command:

::

    serve domain.app /home/vagrant/Code/path/to/public/directory

    **Note:** After running the ``serve`` command, do not forget to add
    the new site to the ``hosts`` file on your main machine!

 ## Ports

The following ports are forwarded to your Homestead environment:

-  **SSH:** 2222 → Forwards To 22
-  **HTTP:** 8000 → Forwards To 80
-  **MySQL:** 33060 → Forwards To 3306
-  **Postgres:** 54320 → Forwards To 5432
