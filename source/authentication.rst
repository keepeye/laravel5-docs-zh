 ## Introduction

Laravel makes implementing authentication very simple. In fact, almost
everything is configured for you out of the box. The authentication
configuration file is located at ``config/auth.php``, which contains
several well documented options for tweaking the behavior of the
authentication services.

By default, Laravel includes an ``App\User`` model in your ``app``
directory. This model may be used with the default Eloquent
authentication driver.

Remember: when building the database schema for this model, make the
password column at least 60 characters. Also, before getting started,
make sure that your ``users`` (or equivalent) table contains a nullable,
string ``remember_token`` column of 100 characters. This column will be
used to store a token for "remember me" sessions being maintained by
your application. This can be done by using ``$table->rememberToken();``
in a migration. Of course, Laravel 5 ships migrations for these columns
out of the box!

If your application is not using Eloquent, you may use the ``database``
authentication driver which uses the Laravel query builder.

 ## Authenticating Users

Laravel ships with two authentication related controllers out of the
box. The ``AuthController`` handles new user registration and "logging
in", while the ``PasswordController`` contains the logic to help
existing users reset their forgotten passwords.

Each of these controllers uses a trait to include their necessary
methods. For many applications, you will not need to modify these
controllers at all. The views that these controllers render are located
in the ``resources/views/auth`` directory. You are free to customize
these views however you wish.

The User Registrar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify the form fields that are required when a new user registers
with your application, you may modify the ``App\Services\Registrar``
class. This class is responsible for validating and creating new users
of your application.

The ``validator`` method of the ``Registrar`` contains the validation
rules for new users of the application, while the ``create`` method of
the ``Registrar`` is responsible for creating new ``User`` records in
your database. You are free to modify each of these methods as you wish.
The ``Registrar`` is called by the ``AuthController`` via the methods
contained in the ``AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers`` trait.

Manual Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you choose not to use the provided ``AuthController`` implementation,
you will need to manage the authentication of your users using the
Laravel authentication classes directly. Don't worry, it's still a
cinch! First, let's check out the ``attempt`` method:

::

    <?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Auth;
    use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;

    class AuthController extends Controller {

        /**
         * Handle an authentication attempt.
         *
         * @return Response
         */
        public function authenticate()
        {
            if (Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password]))
            {
                return redirect()->intended('dashboard');
            }
        }

    }

The ``attempt`` method accepts an array of key / value pairs as its
first argument. The ``password`` value will be
`hashed </docs/5.0/hashing>`__. The other values in the array will be
used to find the user in your database table. So, in the example above,
the user will be retrieved by the value of the ``email`` column. If the
user is found, the hashed password stored in the database will be
compared with the hashed ``password`` value passed to the method via the
array. If the two hashed passwords match, a new authenticated session
will be started for the user.

The ``attempt`` method will return ``true`` if authentication was
successful. Otherwise, ``false`` will be returned.

    **Note:** In this example, ``email`` is not a required option, it is
    merely used as an example. You should use whatever column name
    corresponds to a "username" in your database.

The ``intended`` redirect function will redirect the user to the URL
they were attempting to access before being caught by the authentication
filter. A fallback URI may be given to this method in case the intended
destination is not available.

Authenticating A User With Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You also may add extra conditions to the authentication query:

::

    if (Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password, 'active' => 1]))
    {
        // The user is active, not suspended, and exists.
    }

Determining If A User Is Authenticated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To determine if the user is already logged into your application, you
may use the ``check`` method:

::

    if (Auth::check())
    {
        // The user is logged in...
    }

Authenticating A User And "Remembering" Them
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to provide "remember me" functionality in your
application, you may pass a boolean value as the second argument to the
``attempt`` method, which will keep the user authenticated indefinitely,
or until they manually logout. Of course, your ``users`` table must
include the string ``remember_token`` column, which will be used to
store the "remember me" token.

::

    if (Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password], $remember))
    {
        // The user is being remembered...
    }

If you are "remembering" users, you may use the ``viaRemember`` method
to determine if the user was authenticated using the "remember me"
cookie:

::

    if (Auth::viaRemember())
    {
        //
    }

Authenticating Users By ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To log a user into the application by their ID, use the ``loginUsingId``
method:

::

    Auth::loginUsingId(1);

Validating User Credentials Without Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``validate`` method allows you to validate a user's credentials
without actually logging them into the application:

::

    if (Auth::validate($credentials))
    {
        //
    }

Logging A User In For A Single Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also use the ``once`` method to log a user into the application
for a single request. No sessions or cookies will be utilized:

::

    if (Auth::once($credentials))
    {
        //
    }

Manually Logging In A User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to log an existing user instance into your application, you
may call the ``login`` method with the user instance:

::

    Auth::login($user);

This is equivalent to logging in a user via credentials using the
``attempt`` method.

Logging A User Out Of The Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    Auth::logout();

Of course, if you are using the built-in Laravel authentication
controllers, a controller method that handles logging users out of the
application is provided out of the box.

Authentication Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the ``attempt`` method is called, the ``auth.attempt``
`event </docs/5.0/events>`__ will be fired. If the authentication
attempt is successful and the user is logged in, the ``auth.login``
event will be fired as well.

 ## Retrieving The Authenticated User

Once a user is authenticated, there are several ways to obtain an
instance of the User.

First, you may access the user from the ``Auth`` facade:

::

    <?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;

    class ProfileController extends Controller {

        /**
         * Update the user's profile.
         *
         * @return Response
         */
        public function updateProfile()
        {
            if (Auth::user())
            {
                // Auth::user() returns an instance of the authenticated user...
            }
        }

    }

Second, you may access the authenticated user via an
``Illuminate\Http\Request`` instance:

::

    <?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;

    class ProfileController extends Controller {

        /**
         * Update the user's profile.
         *
         * @return Response
         */
        public function updateProfile(Request $request)
        {
            if ($request->user())
            {
                // $request->user() returns an instance of the authenticated user...
            }
        }

    }

Thirdly, you may type-hint the
``Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable`` contract. This type-hint
may be added to a controller constructor, controller method, or any
other constructor of a class resolved by the `service
container </docs/5.0/container>`__:

::

    <?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;

    class ProfileController extends Controller {

        /**
         * Update the user's profile.
         *
         * @return Response
         */
        public function updateProfile(Authenticatable $user)
        {
            // $user is an instance of the authenticated user...
        }

    }

 ## Protecting Routes

`Route middleware </docs/5.0/middleware>`__ can be used to allow only
authenticated users to access a given route. Laravel provides the
``auth`` middleware by default, and it is defined in
``app\Http\Middleware\Authenticate.php``. All you need to do is attach
it to a route definition:

::

    // With A Route Closure...

    Route::get('profile', ['middleware' => 'auth', function()
    {
        // Only authenticated users may enter...
    }]);

    // With A Controller...

    Route::get('profile', ['middleware' => 'auth', 'uses' => 'ProfileController@show']);

 ## HTTP Basic Authentication

HTTP Basic Authentication provides a quick way to authenticate users of
your application without setting up a dedicated "login" page. To get
started, attach the ``auth.basic`` middleware to your route:

Protecting A Route With HTTP Basic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    Route::get('profile', ['middleware' => 'auth.basic', function()
    {
        // Only authenticated users may enter...
    }]);

By default, the ``basic`` middleware will use the ``email`` column on
the user record as the "username".

Setting Up A Stateless HTTP Basic Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also use HTTP Basic Authentication without setting a user
identifier cookie in the session, which is particularly useful for API
authentication. To do so, `define a middleware </docs/5.0/middleware>`__
that calls the ``onceBasic`` method:

::

    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        return Auth::onceBasic() ?: $next($request);
    }

If you are using PHP FastCGI, HTTP Basic authentication may not work
correctly out of the box. The following lines should be added to your
``.htaccess`` file:

::

    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.+)$
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

 ## Password Reminders & Reset

Model & Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most web applications provide a way for users to reset their forgotten
passwords. Rather than forcing you to re-implement this on each
application, Laravel provides convenient methods for sending password
reminders and performing password resets.

To get started, verify that your ``User`` model implements the
``Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\CanResetPassword`` contract. Of course, the
``User`` model included with the framework already implements this
interface, and uses the ``Illuminate\Auth\Passwords\CanResetPassword``
trait to include the methods needed to implement the interface.

Generating The Reminder Table Migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, a table must be created to store the password reset tokens. The
migration for this table is included with Laravel out of the box, and
resides in the ``database/migrations`` directory. So all you need to do
is migrate:

::

    php artisan migrate

Password Reminder Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel also includes an ``Auth\PasswordController`` that contains the
logic necessary to reset user passwords. We've even provided views to
get you started! The views are located in the ``resources/views/auth``
directory. You are free to modify these views as you wish to suit your
own application's design.

Your user will receive an e-mail with a link that points to the
``getReset`` method of the ``PasswordController``. This method will
render the password reset form and allow users to reset their passwords.
After the password is reset, the user will automatically be logged into
the application and redirected to ``/home``. You can customize the
post-reset redirect location by defining a ``redirectTo`` property on
the ``PasswordController``:

::

    protected $redirectTo = '/dashboard';

    **Note:** By default, password reset tokens expire after one hour.
    You may change this via the ``reminder.expire`` option of your
    ``config/auth.php`` file.

 ## Social Authentication

In addition to typical, form based authentication, Laravel also provides
a simple, convenient way to authenticate with OAuth providers using
`Laravel Socialite <https://github.com/laravel/socialite>`__.
**Socialite currently supports authentication with Facebook, Twitter,
Google, and GitHub.**

To get started with Socialite, include the package in your
``composer.json`` file:

::

    "laravel/socialite": "~2.0"

Next, register the ``Laravel\Socialite\SocialiteServiceProvider`` in
your ``config/app.php`` configuration file. You may also register a
`facade </docs/5.0/facades>`__:

::

    'Socialize' => 'Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite',

You will need to add credentials for the OAuth services your application
utilizes. These credentials should be placed in your
``config/services.php`` configuration file, and should use the key
``facebook``, ``twitter``, ``google``, or ``github``, depending on the
providers your application requires. For example:

::

    'github' => [
        'client_id' => 'your-github-app-id',
        'client_secret' => 'your-github-app-secret',
        'redirect' => 'http://your-callback-url',
    ],

Next, you are ready to authenticate users! You will need two routes: one
for redirecting the user to the OAuth provider, and another for
receiving the callback from the provider after authentication. Here's an
example using the ``Socialize`` facade:

::

    public function redirectToProvider()
    {
        return Socialize::with('github')->redirect();
    }

    public function handleProviderCallback()
    {
        $user = Socialize::with('github')->user();

        // $user->token;
    }

The ``redirect`` method takes care of sending the user to the OAuth
provider, while the ``user`` method will read the incoming request and
retrieve the user's information from the provider. Before redirecting
the user, you may also set "scopes" on the request:

::

    return Socialize::with('github')->scopes(['scope1', 'scope2'])->redirect();

Once you have a user instance, you can grab a few more details about the
user:

Retrieving User Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $user = Socialize::with('github')->user();

    // OAuth Two Providers
    $token = $user->token;

    // OAuth One Providers
    $token = $user->token;
    $tokenSecret = $user->tokenSecret;

    // All Providers
    $user->getNickname();
    $user->getName();
    $user->getEmail();
    $user->getAvatar();
