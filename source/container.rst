 ## Introduction

The Laravel service container is a powerful tool for managing class
dependencies. Dependency injection is a fancy word that essentially
means this: class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the
constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.

Let's look at a simple example:

::

    <?php namespace App\Handlers\Commands;

    use App\User;
    use App\Commands\PurchasePodcast;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Mail\Mailer;

    class PurchasePodcastHandler {

        /**
         * The mailer implementation.
         */
        protected $mailer;

        /**
         * Create a new instance.
         *
         * @param  Mailer  $mailer
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(Mailer $mailer)
        {
            $this->mailer = $mailer;
        }

        /**
         * Purchase a podcast.
         *
         * @param  PurchasePodcastCommand  $command
         * @return void
         */
        public function handle(PurchasePodcastCommand $command)
        {
            //
        }

    }

In this example, the ``PurchasePodcast`` command handler needs to send
e-mails when a podcast is purchased. So, we will **inject** a service
that is able to send e-mails. Since the service is injected, we are able
to easily swap it out with another implementation. We are also able to
easily "mock", or create a dummy implementation of the mailer when
testing our application.

A deep understanding of the Laravel service container is essential to
building a powerful, large application, as well as for contributing to
the Laravel core itself.

 ## Basic Usage

Binding
~~~~~~~

Almost all of your service container bindings will be registered within
`service providers </docs/5.0/providers>`__, so all of these examples
will demonstrate using the container in that context. However, if you
need an instance of the container elsewhere in your application, such as
a factory, you may type-hint the
``Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container`` contract and an instance of
the container will be injected for you. Alternatively, you may use the
``App`` facade to access the container.

Registering A Basic Resolver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within a service provider, you always have access to the container via
the ``$this->app`` instance variable.

There are several ways the service container can register dependencies,
including Closure callbacks and binding interfaces to implementations.
First, we'll explore Closure callbacks. A Closure resolver is registered
in the container with a key (typically the class name) and a Closure
that returns some value:

::

    $this->app->bind('FooBar', function($app)
    {
        return new FooBar($app['SomethingElse']);
    });

Registering A Singleton
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, you may wish to bind something into the container that should
only be resolved once, and the same instance should be returned on
subsequent calls into the container:

::

    $this->app->singleton('FooBar', function($app)
    {
        return new FooBar($app['SomethingElse']);
    });

Binding An Existing Instance Into The Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also bind an existing object instance into the container using
the ``instance`` method. The given instance will always be returned on
subsequent calls into the container:

::

    $fooBar = new FooBar(new SomethingElse);

    $this->app->instance('FooBar', $fooBar);

Resolving
~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to resolve something out of the container. First,
you may use the ``make`` method:

::

    $fooBar = $this->app->make('FooBar');

Secondly, you may use "array access" on the container, since it
implements PHP's ``ArrayAccess`` interface:

::

    $fooBar = $this->app['FooBar'];

Lastly, but most importantly, you may simply "type-hint" the dependency
in the constructor of a class that is resolved by the container,
including controllers, event listeners, queue jobs, filters, and more.
The container will automatically inject the dependencies:

::

    <?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;
    use App\Users\Repository as UserRepository;

    class UserController extends Controller {

        /**
         * The user repository instance.
         */
        protected $users;

        /**
         * Create a new controller instance.
         *
         * @param  UserRepository  $users
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(UserRepository $users)
        {
            $this->users = $users;
        }

        /**
         * Show the user with the given ID.
         *
         * @param  int  $id
         * @return Response
         */
        public function show($id)
        {
            //
        }

    }

 ## Binding Interfaces To Implementations

Injecting Concrete Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very powerful features of the service container is its ability to bind
an interface to a given implementation. For example, perhaps our
application integrates with the `Pusher <https://pusher.com>`__ web
service for sending and receiving real-time events. If we are using
Pusher's PHP SDK, we could inject an instance of the Pusher client into
a class:

::

    <?php namespace App\Handlers\Commands;

    use App\Commands\CreateOrder;
    use Pusher\Client as PusherClient;

    class CreateOrderHandler {

        /**
         * The Pusher SDK client instance.
         */
        protected $pusher;

        /**
         * Create a new order handler instance.
         *
         * @param  PusherClient  $pusher
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(PusherClient $pusher)
        {
            $this->pusher = $pusher;
        }

        /**
         * Execute the given command.
         *
         * @param  CreateOrder  $command
         * @return void
         */
        public function execute(CreateOrder $command)
        {
            //
        }

    }

In this example, it is good that we are injecting the class
dependencies; however, we are tightly coupled to the Pusher SDK. If the
Pusher SDK methods change or we decide to switch to a new event service
entirely, we will need to change our ``CreateOrderHandler`` code.

Program To An Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to "insulate" the ``CreateOrderHandler`` against changes to
event pushing, we could define an ``EventPusher`` interface and a
``PusherEventPusher`` implementation:

::

    <?php namespace App\Contracts;

    interface EventPusher {

        /**
         * Push a new event to all clients.
         *
         * @param  string  $event
         * @param  array  $data
         * @return void
         */
        public function push($event, array $data);

    }

Once we have coded our ``PusherEventPusher`` implementation of this
interface, we can register it with the service container like so:

::

    $this->app->bind('App\Contracts\EventPusher', 'App\Services\PusherEventPusher');

This tells the container that it should inject the ``PusherEventPusher``
when a class needs an implementation of ``EventPusher``. Now we can
type-hint the ``EventPusher`` interface in our constructor:

::

        /**
         * Create a new order handler instance.
         *
         * @param  EventPusher  $pusher
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(EventPusher $pusher)
        {
            $this->pusher = $pusher;
        }

 ## Contextual Binding

Sometimes you may have two classes that utilize the same interface, but
you wish to inject different implementations into each class. For
example, when our system receives a new Order, we may want to send an
event via `PubNub <http://www.pubnub.com/>`__ rather than Pusher.
Laravel provides a simple, fluent interface for definining this
behavior:

::

    $this->app->when('App\Handlers\Commands\CreateOrderHandler')
              ->needs('App\Contracts\EventPusher')
              ->give('App\Services\PubNubEventPusher');

 ## Tagging

Occasionally, you may need to resolve all of a certain "category" of
binding. For example, perhaps you are building a report aggregator that
receives an array of many different ``Report`` interface
implementations. After registering the ``Report`` implementations, you
can assign them a tag using the ``tag`` method:

::

    $this->app->bind('SpeedReport', function()
    {
        //
    });

    $this->app->bind('MemoryReport', function()
    {
        //
    });

    $this->app->tag(['SpeedReport', 'MemoryReport'], 'reports');

Once the services have been tagged, you may easily resolve them all via
the ``tagged`` method:

::

    $this->app->bind('ReportAggregator', function($app)
    {
        return new ReportAggregator($app->tagged('reports'));
    });

 ## Practical Applications

Laravel provides several opportunities to use the service container to
increase the flexibility and testability of your application. One
primary example is when resolving controllers. All controllers are
resolved through the service container, meaning you can type-hint
dependencies in a controller constructor, and they will automatically be
injected.

::

    <?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;
    use App\Repositories\OrderRepository;

    class OrdersController extends Controller {

        /**
         * The order repository instance.
         */
        protected $orders;

        /**
         * Create a controller instance.
         *
         * @param  OrderRepository  $orders
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(OrderRepository $orders)
        {
            $this->orders = $orders;
        }

        /**
         * Show all of the orders.
         *
         * @return Response
         */
        public function index()
        {
            $all = $this->orders->all();

            return view('orders', ['all' => $all]);
        }

    }

In this example, the ``OrderRepository`` class will automatically be
injected into the controller. This means that a "mock"
``OrderRepository`` may be bound into the container when `unit
testing </docs/5.0/testing>`__, allowing for painless stubbing of
database layer interaction.

Other Examples Of Container Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Of course, as mentioned above, controllers are not the only classes
Laravel resolves via the service container. You may also type-hint
dependencies on route Closures, filters, queue jobs, event listeners,
and more. For examples of using the service container in these contexts,
please refer to their documentation.

 ## Container Events

Registering A Resolving Listener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The container fires an event each time it resolves an object. You may
listen to this event using the ``resolving`` method:

::

    $this->app->resolving(function($object, $app)
    {
        // Called when container resolves object of any type...
    });

    $this->app->resolving(function(FooBar $fooBar, $app)
    {
        // Called when container resolves objects of type "FooBar"...
    });

The object being resolved will be passed to the callback.
