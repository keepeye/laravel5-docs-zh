 ## Basic Usage

The Laravel event facilities provides a simple observer implementation,
allowing you to subscribe and listen for events in your application.
Event classes are typically stored in the ``app/Events`` directory,
while their handlers are stored in ``app/Handlers/Events``.

You can generate a new event class using the Artisan CLI tool:

::

    php artisan make:event PodcastWasPurchased

Subscribing To An Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``EventServiceProvider`` included with your Laravel application
provides a convenient place to register all event handlers. The
``listen`` property contains an array of all events (keys) and their
handlers (values). Of course, you may add as many events to this array
as your application requires. For example, let's add our
``PodcastWasPurchased`` event:

::

    /**
     * The event handler mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $listen = [
        'App\Events\PodcastWasPurchased' => [
            'App\Handlers\Events\EmailPurchaseConfirmation@handle',
        ],
    ];

To generate a handler for an event, use the ``handler:event`` Artisan
CLI command:

::

    php artisan handler:event EmailPurchaseConfirmation --event=PodcastWasPurchased

Of course, manually running the ``make:event`` and ``handler:event``
commands each time you need a handler or event is cumbersome. Instead,
simply add handlers and events to your ``EventServiceProvider`` and use
the ``event:generate`` command. This command will generate any events or
handlers that are listed in your ``EventServiceProvider``:

::

    php artisan event:generate

Firing An Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we are ready to fire our event using the ``Event`` facade:

::

    $response = Event::fire(new PodcastWasPurchased($podcast));

The ``fire`` method returns an array of responses that you can use to
control what happens next in your application.

You may also use the ``event`` helper to fire an event:

::

    event(new PodcastWasPurchased($podcast));

Closure Listeners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can even listen to events without creating a separate handler class
at all. For example, in the ``boot`` method of your
``EventServiceProvider``, you could do the following:

::

    Event::listen('App\Events\PodcastWasPurchased', function($event)
    {
        // Handle the event...
    });

Stopping The Propagation Of An Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, you may wish to stop the propagation of an event to other
listeners. You may do so using by returning ``false`` from your handler:

::

    Event::listen('App\Events\PodcastWasPurchased', function($event)
    {
        // Handle the event...

        return false;
    });

 ## Queued Event Handlers

Need to `queue </docs/5.0/queues>`__ an event handler? It couldn't be
any easier. When generating the handler, simply use the ``--queued``
flag:

::

    php artisan handler:event SendPurchaseConfirmation --event=PodcastWasPurchased --queued

This will generate a handler class that implements the
``Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeQueued`` interface. That's it! Now
when this handler is called for an event, it will be queued
automatically by the event dispatcher.

If no exceptions are thrown when the handler is executed by the queue,
the queued job will be deleted automatically after it has processed. If
you need to access the queued job's ``delete`` and ``release`` methods
manually, you may do so. The ``Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue``
trait, which is included by default on queued handlers, gives you access
to these methods:

::

    public function handle(PodcastWasPurchased $event)
    {
        if (true)
        {
            $this->release(30);
        }
    }

If you have an existing handler that you would like to convert to a
queued handler, simply add the ``ShouldBeQueued`` interface to the class
manually.

 ## Event Subscribers

Defining An Event Subscriber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Event subscribers are classes that may subscribe to multiple events from
within the class itself. Subscribers should define a ``subscribe``
method, which will be passed an event dispatcher instance:

::

    class UserEventHandler {

        /**
         * Handle user login events.
         */
        public function onUserLogin($event)
        {
            //
        }

        /**
         * Handle user logout events.
         */
        public function onUserLogout($event)
        {
            //
        }

        /**
         * Register the listeners for the subscriber.
         *
         * @param  Illuminate\Events\Dispatcher  $events
         * @return array
         */
        public function subscribe($events)
        {
            $events->listen('App\Events\UserLoggedIn', 'UserEventHandler@onUserLogin');

            $events->listen('App\Events\UserLoggedOut', 'UserEventHandler@onUserLogout');
        }

    }

Registering An Event Subscriber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the subscriber has been defined, it may be registered with the
``Event`` class.

::

    $subscriber = new UserEventHandler;

    Event::subscribe($subscriber);

You may also use the `Laravel IoC container </docs/5.0/container>`__ to
resolve your subscriber. To do so, simply pass the name of your
subscriber to the ``subscribe`` method:

::

    Event::subscribe('UserEventHandler');
