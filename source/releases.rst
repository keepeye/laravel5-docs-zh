Release Notes
=============

-  `Laravel 5.0 <#laravel-5.0>`__
-  `Laravel 4.2 <#laravel-4.2>`__
-  `Laravel 4.1 <#laravel-4.1>`__

 ## Laravel 5.0

Laravel 5.0 introduces a fresh application structure to the default
Laravel project. This new structure serves as a better foundation for
building robust application in Laravel, as well as embraces new
auto-loading standards (PSR-4) throughout the application. First, let's
examine some of the major changes:

New Folder Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The old ``app/models`` directory has been entirely removed. Instead, all
of your code lives directly within the ``app`` folder, and, by default,
is organized to the ``App`` namespace. This default namespace can be
quickly changed using the new ``app:name`` Artisan command.

Controllers, middleware, and requests (a new type of class in Laravel
5.0) are now grouped under the ``app/Http`` directory, as they are all
classes related to the HTTP transport layer of your application. Instead
of a single, flat file of route filters, all middleware are now broken
into their own class files.

A new ``app/Providers`` directory replaces the ``app/start`` files from
previous versions of Laravel 4.x. These service providers provide
various bootstrapping functions to your application, such as error
handling, logging, route loading, and more. Of course, you are free to
create additional service providers for your application.

Application language files and views have been moved to the
``resources`` directory.

Contracts
~~~~~~~~~

All major Laravel components implement interfaces which are located in
the ``illuminate/contracts`` repository. This repository has no external
dependencies. Having a convenient, centrally located set of interfaces
you may use for decoupling and dependency injection will serve as an
easy alternative option to Laravel Facades.

For more information on contracts, consult the `full
documentation </docs/5.0/contracts>`__.

Route Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application is made up entirely of controller routes, you may
utilize the new ``route:cache`` Artisan command to drastically speed up
the registration of your routes. This is primarily useful on
applications with 100+ routes and will **drastically** speed up this
portion of your application.

Route Middleware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to Laravel 4 style route "filters", Laravel 5 now supports
HTTP middleware, and the included authentication and CSRF "filters" have
been converted to middleware. Middleware provides a single, consistent
interface to replace all types of filters, allowing you to easily
inspect, and even reject, requests before they enter your application.

For more information on middleware, check out `the
documentation </docs/5.0/middleware>`__.

Controller Method Injection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the existing constructor injection, you may now type-hint
dependencies on controller methods. The `IoC
container </docs/5.0/container>`__ will automatically inject the
dependencies, even if the route contains other parameters:

::

    public function createPost(Request $request, PostRepository $posts)
    {
        //
    }

Authentication Scaffolding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User registration, authentication, and password reset controllers are
now included out of the box, as well as simple corresponding views,
which are located at ``resources/views/auth``. In addition, a "users"
table migration has been included with the framework. Including these
simple resources allows rapid development of application ideas without
bogging down on authentication boilerplate. The authentication views may
be accessed on the ``auth/login`` and ``auth/register`` routes. The
``App\Services\Auth\Registrar`` service is responsible for user
validation and creation.

Event Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may now define events as objects instead of simply using strings.
For example, check out the following event:

::

    class PodcastWasPurchased {

        public $podcast;

        public function __construct(Podcast $podcast)
        {
            $this->podcast = $podcast;
        }

    }

The event may be dispatched like normal:

::

    Event::fire(new PodcastWasPurchased($podcast));

Of course, your event handler will receive the event object instead of a
list of data:

::

    class ReportPodcastPurchase {

        public function handle(PodcastWasPurchased $event)
        {
            //
        }

    }

For more information on working with events, check out the `full
documentation </docs/5.0/events>`__.

Commands / Queueing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the queue job format supported in Laravel 4, Laravel 5
allows you to represent your queued jobs as simple command objects.
These commands live in the ``app/Commands`` directory. Here's a sample
command:

::

    class PurchasePodcast extends Command implements SelfHandling, ShouldBeQueued {

        use SerializesModels;

        protected $user, $podcast;

        /**
         * Create a new command instance.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct(User $user, Podcast $podcast)
        {
            $this->user = $user;
            $this->podcast = $podcast;
        }

        /**
         * Execute the command.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function handle()
        {
            // Handle the logic to purchase the podcast...

            event(new PodcastWasPurchased($this->user, $this->podcast));
        }

    }

The base Laravel controller utilizes the new ``DispatchesCommands``
trait, allowing you to easily dispatch your commands for execution:

::

    $this->dispatch(new PurchasePodcastCommand($user, $podcast));

Of course, you may also use commands for tasks that are executed
synchonrously (are not queued). In fact, using commands is a great way
to encapsulate complex tasks your application needs to perform. For more
information, check out the `command bus </docs/5.0/bus>`__
documentation.

Database Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``database`` queue driver is now included in Laravel, providing a
simple, local queue driver that requires no extra package installation
beyond your database software.

Laravel Scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the past, developers have generated a Cron entry for each console
command they wished to schedule. However, this is a headache. Your
console schedule is no longer in source control, and you must SSH into
your server to add the Cron entries. Let's make our lives easier. The
Laravel command scheduler allows you to fluently and expressively define
your command schedule within Laravel itself, and only a single Cron
entry is needed on your server.

It looks like this:

::

    $schedule->command('artisan:command')->dailyAt('15:00');

Of course, check out the `full
documentation </docs/5.0/artisan#scheduling-artisan-commands>`__ to
learn all about the scheduler!

Tinker / Psysh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``php artisan tinker`` command now utilizes
`Psysh <https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh>`__ by Justin Hileman, a more
robust REPL for PHP. If you liked Boris in Laravel 4, you're going to
love Psysh. Even better, it works on Windows! To get started, just try:

::

    php artisan tinker

DotEnv
~~~~~~

Instead of a variety of confusing, nested environment configuration
directories, Laravel 5 now utilizes
`DotEnv <https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv>`__ by Vance Lucas. This
library provides a super simple way to manage your environment
configuration, and makes environment detection in Laravel 5 a breeze.
For more details, check out the full `configuration
documentation </docs/5.0/configuration#environment-configuration>`__.

Laravel Elixir
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel Elixir, by Jeffrey Way, provides a fluent, expressive interface
to compiling and concatenating your assets. If you've ever been
intimidated by learning Grunt or Gulp, fear no more. Elixir makes it a
cinch to get started using Gulp to compile your Less, Sass, and
CoffeeScript. It can even run your tests for you!

For more information on Elixir, check out the `full
documentation </docs/5.0/elixir>`__.

Laravel Socialite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel Socialite is an optional, Laravel 5.0+ compatible package that
provides totally painless authentication with OAuth providers.
Currently, Socialite supports Facebook, Twitter, Google, and GitHub.
Here's what it looks like:

::

    public function redirectForAuth()
    {
        return Socialize::with('twitter')->redirect();
    }

    public function getUserFromProvider()
    {
        $user = Socialize::with('twitter')->user();
    }

No more spending hours writing OAuth authentication flows. Get started
in minutes! The `full
documentation </docs/5.0/authentication#social-authentication>`__ has
all the details.

Flysystem Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel now includes the powerful
`Flysystem <https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem>`__ filesystem
abstraction library, providing pain free integration with local, Amazon
S3, and Rackspace cloud storage - all with one, unified and elegant API!
Storing a file in Amazon S3 is now as simple as:

::

    Storage::put('file.txt', 'contents');

For more information on the Laravel Flysystem integration, consult the
`full documentation </docs/5.0/filesystem>`__.

Form Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel 5.0 introduces **form requests**, which extend the
``Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest`` class. These request objects
can be combined with controller method injection to provide a
boiler-plate free method of validating user input. Let's dig in and look
at a sample ``FormRequest``:

::

    <?php namespace App\Http\Requests;

    class RegisterRequest extends FormRequest {

        public function rules()
        {
            return [
                'email' => 'required|email|unique:users',
                'password' => 'required|confirmed|min:8',
            ];
        }

        public function authorize()
        {
            return true;
        }

    }

Once the class has been defined, we can type-hint it on our controller
action:

::

    public function register(RegisterRequest $request)
    {
        var_dump($request->input());
    }

When the Laravel IoC container identifies that the class it is injecting
is a ``FormRequest`` instance, the request will **automatically be
validated**. This means that if your controller action is called, you
can safely assume the HTTP request input has been validated according to
the rules you specified in your form request class. Even more, if the
request is invalid, an HTTP redirect, which you may customize, will
automatically be issued, and the error messages will be either flashed
to the session or converted to JSON. **Form validation has never been
more simple.** For more information on ``FormRequest`` validation, check
out the
`documentation </docs/5.0/validation#form-request-validation>`__.

Simple Controller Request Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Laravel 5 base controller now includes a ``ValidatesRequests``
trait. This trait provides a simple ``validate`` method to validate
incoming requests. If ``FormRequests`` are a little too much for your
application, check this out:

::

    public function createPost(Request $request)
    {
        $this->validate($request, [
            'title' => 'required|max:255',
            'body' => 'required',
        ]);
    }

If the validation fails, an exception will be thrown and the proper HTTP
response will automatically be sent back to the browser. The validation
errors will even be flashed to the session! If the request was an AJAX
request, Laravel even takes care of sending a JSON representation of the
validation errors back to you.

For more information on this new method, check out `the
documentation </docs/5.0/validation#controller-validation>`__.

New Generators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compliment the new default application structure, new Artisan
generator commands have been added to the framework. See
``php artisan list`` for more details.

Configuration Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may now cache all of your configuration in a single file using the
``config:cache`` command.

Symfony VarDumper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The popular ``dd`` helper function, which dumps variable debug
information, has been upgraded to use the amazing Symfony VarDumper.
This provides color-coded output and even collapsing of arrays. Just try
the following in your project:

::

    dd([1, 2, 3]);

 ## Laravel 4.2

The full change list for this release by running the
``php artisan changes`` command from a 4.2 installation, or by `viewing
the change file on
Github <https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Foundation/changes.json>`__.
These notes only cover the major enhancements and changes for the
release.

    **Note:** During the 4.2 release cycle, many small bug fixes and
    enhancements were incorporated into the various Laravel 4.1 point
    releases. So, be sure to check the change list for Laravel 4.1 as
    well!

PHP 5.4 Requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel 4.2 requires PHP 5.4 or greater. This upgraded PHP requirement
allows us to use new PHP features such as traits to provide more
expressive interfaces for tools like `Laravel
Cashier </docs/billing>`__. PHP 5.4 also brings significant speed and
performance improvements over PHP 5.3.

Laravel Forge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel Forge, a new web based application, provides a simple way to
create and manage PHP servers on the cloud of your choice, including
Linode, DigitalOcean, Rackspace, and Amazon EC2. Supporting automated
Nginx configuration, SSH key access, Cron job automation, server
monitoring via NewRelic & Papertrail, "Push To Deploy", Laravel queue
worker configuration, and more, Forge provides the simplest and most
affordable way to launch all of your Laravel applications.

The default Laravel 4.2 installation's ``app/config/database.php``
configuration file is now configured for Forge usage by default,
allowing for more convenient deployment of fresh applications onto the
platform.

More information about Laravel Forge can be found on the `official Forge
website <https://forge.laravel.com>`__.

Laravel Homestead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel Homestead is an official Vagrant environment for developing
robust Laravel and PHP applications. The vast majority of the boxes'
provisioning needs are handled before the box is packaged for
distribution, allowing the box to boot extremely quickly. Homestead
includes Nginx 1.6, PHP 5.6, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Memcached,
Beanstalk, Node, Gulp, Grunt, & Bower. Homestead includes a simple
``Homestead.yaml`` configuration file for managing multiple Laravel
applications on a single box.

The default Laravel 4.2 installation now includes an
``app/config/local/database.php`` configuration file that is configured
to use the Homestead database out of the box, making Laravel initial
installation and configuration more convenient.

The official documentation has also been updated to include `Homestead
documentation </docs/homestead>`__.

Laravel Cashier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel Cashier is a simple, expressive library for managing
subscription billing with Stripe. With the introduction of Laravel 4.2,
we are including Cashier documentation along with the main Laravel
documentation, though installation of the component itself is still
optional. This release of Cashier brings numerous bug fixes,
multi-currency support, and compatibility with the latest Stripe API.

Daemon Queue Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Artisan ``queue:work`` command now supports a ``--daemon`` option to
start a worker in "daemon mode", meaning the worker will continue to
process jobs without ever re-booting the framework. This results in a
significant reduction in CPU usage at the cost of a slightly more
complex application deployment process.

More information about daemon queue workers can be found in the `queue
documentation </docs/queues#daemon-queue-worker>`__.

Mail API Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel 4.2 introduces new Mailgun and Mandrill API drivers for the
``Mail`` functions. For many applications, this provides a faster and
more reliable method of sending e-mails than the SMTP options. The new
drivers utilize the Guzzle 4 HTTP library.

Soft Deleting Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A much cleaner architecture for "soft deletes" and other "global scopes"
has been introduced via PHP 5.4 traits. This new architecture allows for
the easier construction of similar global traits, and a cleaner
separation of concerns within the framework itself.

More information on the new ``SoftDeletingTrait`` may be found in the
`Eloquent documentation </docs/eloquent#soft-deleting>`__.

Convenient Auth & Remindable Traits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default Laravel 4.2 installation now uses simple traits for
including the needed properties for the authentication and password
reminder user interfaces. This provides a much cleaner default ``User``
model file out of the box.

"Simple Paginate"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new ``simplePaginate`` method was added to the query and Eloquent
builder which allows for more efficient queries when using simple "Next"
and "Previous" links in your pagination view.

Migration Confirmation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In production, destructive migration operations will now ask for
confirmation. Commands may be forced to run without any prompts using
the ``--force`` command.

 ## Laravel 4.1

Full Change List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The full change list for this release by running the
``php artisan changes`` command from a 4.1 installation, or by `viewing
the change file on
Github <https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.1/src/Illuminate/Foundation/changes.json>`__.
These notes only cover the major enhancements and changes for the
release.

New SSH Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An entirely new ``SSH`` component has been introduced with this release.
This feature allows you to easily SSH into remote servers and run
commands. To learn more, consult the `SSH component
documentation </docs/ssh>`__.

The new ``php artisan tail`` command utilizes the new SSH component. For
more information, consult the ``tail`` `command
documentation <http://laravel.com/docs/ssh#tailing-remote-logs>`__.

Boris In Tinker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``php artisan tinker`` command now utilizes the `Boris
REPL <https://github.com/d11wtq/boris>`__ if your system supports it.
The ``readline`` and ``pcntl`` PHP extensions must be installed to use
this feature. If you do not have these extensions, the shell from 4.0
will be used.

Eloquent Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new ``hasManyThrough`` relationship has been added to Eloquent. To
learn how to use it, consult the `Eloquent
documentation </docs/eloquent#has-many-through>`__.

A new ``whereHas`` method has also been introduced to allow `retrieving
models based on relationship
constraints </docs/eloquent#querying-relations>`__.

Database Read / Write Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatic handling of separate read / write connections is now available
throughout the database layer, including the query builder and Eloquent.
For more information, consult `the
documentation </docs/database#read-write-connections>`__.

Queue Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queue priorities are now supported by passing a comma-delimited list to
the ``queue:listen`` command.

Failed Queue Job Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The queue facilities now include automatic handling of failed jobs when
using the new ``--tries`` switch on ``queue:listen``. More information
on handling failed jobs can be found in the `queue
documentation </docs/queues#failed-jobs>`__.

Cache Tags
~~~~~~~~~~

Cache "sections" have been superseded by "tags". Cache tags allow you to
assign multiple "tags" to a cache item, and flush all items assigned to
a single tag. More information on using cache tags may be found in the
`cache documentation </docs/cache#cache-tags>`__.

Flexible Password Reminders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The password reminder engine has been changed to provide greater
developer flexibility when validating passwords, flashing status
messages to the session, etc. For more information on using the enhanced
password reminder engine, `consult the
documentation </docs/security#password-reminders-and-reset>`__.

Improved Routing Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Laravel 4.1 features a totally re-written routing layer. The API is the
same; however, registering routes is a full 100% faster compared to 4.0.
The entire engine has been greatly simplified, and the dependency on
Symfony Routing has been minimized to the compiling of route
expressions.

Improved Session Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this release, we're also introducing an entirely new session
engine. Similar to the routing improvements, the new session layer is
leaner and faster. We are no longer using Symfony's (and therefore
PHP's) session handling facilities, and are using a custom solution that
is simpler and easier to maintain.

Doctrine DBAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the ``renameColumn`` function in your migrations, you
will need to add the ``doctrine/dbal`` dependency to your
``composer.json`` file. This package is no longer included in Laravel by
default.
