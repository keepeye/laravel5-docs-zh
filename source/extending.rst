-  `Authentication <#authentication>`__
-  `IoC Based Extension <#ioc-based-extension>`__

 ## Managers & Factories

Laravel has several ``Manager`` classes that manage the creation of
driver-based components. These include the cache, session,
authentication, and queue components. The manager class is responsible
for creating a particular driver implementation based on the
application's configuration. For example, the ``CacheManager`` class can
create APC, Memcached, File, and various other implementations of cache
drivers.

Each of these managers includes an ``extend`` method which may be used
to easily inject new driver resolution functionality into the manager.
We'll cover each of these managers below, with examples of how to inject
custom driver support into each of them.

    **Note:** Take a moment to explore the various ``Manager`` classes
    that ship with Laravel, such as the ``CacheManager`` and
    ``SessionManager``. Reading through these classes will give you a
    more thorough understanding of how Laravel works under the hood. All
    manager classes extend the ``Illuminate\Support\Manager`` base
    class, which provides some helpful, common functionality for each
    manager.

 ## Cache

To extend the Laravel cache facility, we will use the ``extend`` method
on the ``CacheManager``, which is used to bind a custom driver resolver
to the manager, and is common across all manager classes. For example,
to register a new cache driver named "mongo", we would do the following:

::

    Cache::extend('mongo', function($app)
    {
        return Cache::repository(new MongoStore);
    });

The first argument passed to the ``extend`` method is the name of the
driver. This will correspond to your ``driver`` option in the
``config/cache.php`` configuration file. The second argument is a
Closure that should return an ``Illuminate\Cache\Repository`` instance.
The Closure will be passed an ``$app`` instance, which is an instance of
``Illuminate\Foundation\Application`` and an IoC container.

The call to ``Cache::extend`` could be done in the ``boot`` method of
the default ``App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`` that ships with fresh
Laravel applications, or you may create your own service provider to
house the extension - just don't forget to register the provider in the
``config/app.php`` provider array.

To create our custom cache driver, we first need to implement the
``Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Store`` contract. So, our MongoDB cache
implementation would look something like this:

::

    class MongoStore implements Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Store {

        public function get($key) {}
        public function put($key, $value, $minutes) {}
        public function increment($key, $value = 1) {}
        public function decrement($key, $value = 1) {}
        public function forever($key, $value) {}
        public function forget($key) {}
        public function flush() {}

    }

We just need to implement each of these methods using a MongoDB
connection. Once our implementation is complete, we can finish our
custom driver registration:

::

    Cache::extend('mongo', function($app)
    {
        return Cache::repository(new MongoStore);
    });

If you're wondering where to put your custom cache driver code, consider
making it available on Packagist! Or, you could create an ``Extensions``
namespace within your ``app`` directory. However, keep in mind that
Laravel does not have a rigid application structure and you are free to
organize your application according to your preferences.

 ## Session

Extending Laravel with a custom session driver is just as easy as
extending the cache system. Again, we will use the ``extend`` method to
register our custom code:

::

    Session::extend('mongo', function($app)
    {
        // Return implementation of SessionHandlerInterface
    });

Where To Extend The Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should place your session extension code in the ``boot`` method of
your ``AppServiceProvider``.

Writing The Session Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that our custom session driver should implement the
``SessionHandlerInterface``. This interface contains just a few simple
methods we need to implement. A stubbed MongoDB implementation would
look something like this:

::

    class MongoHandler implements SessionHandlerInterface {

        public function open($savePath, $sessionName) {}
        public function close() {}
        public function read($sessionId) {}
        public function write($sessionId, $data) {}
        public function destroy($sessionId) {}
        public function gc($lifetime) {}

    }

Since these methods are not as readily understandable as the cache
``StoreInterface``, let's quickly cover what each of the methods do:

-  The ``open`` method would typically be used in file based session
   store systems. Since Laravel ships with a ``file`` session driver,
   you will almost never need to put anything in this method. You can
   leave it as an empty stub. It is simply a fact of poor interface
   design (which we'll discuss later) that PHP requires us to implement
   this method.
-  The ``close`` method, like the ``open`` method, can also usually be
   disregarded. For most drivers, it is not needed.
-  The ``read`` method should return the string version of the session
   data associated with the given ``$sessionId``. There is no need to do
   any serialization or other encoding when retrieving or storing
   session data in your driver, as Laravel will perform the
   serialization for you.
-  The ``write`` method should write the given ``$data`` string
   associated with the ``$sessionId`` to some persistent storage system,
   such as MongoDB, Dynamo, etc.
-  The ``destroy`` method should remove the data associated with the
   ``$sessionId`` from persistent storage.
-  The ``gc`` method should destroy all session data that is older than
   the given ``$lifetime``, which is a UNIX timestamp. For self-expiring
   systems like Memcached and Redis, this method may be left empty.

Once the ``SessionHandlerInterface`` has been implemented, we are ready
to register it with the Session manager:

::

    Session::extend('mongo', function($app)
    {
        return new MongoHandler;
    });

Once the session driver has been registered, we may use the ``mongo``
driver in our ``config/session.php`` configuration file.

    **Note:** Remember, if you write a custom session handler, share it
    on Packagist!

 ## Authentication

Authentication may be extended the same way as the cache and session
facilities. Again, we will use the ``extend`` method we have become
familiar with:

::

    Auth::extend('riak', function($app)
    {
        // Return implementation of Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider
    });

The ``UserProvider`` implementations are only responsible for fetching a
``Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable`` implementation out of a
persistent storage system, such as MySQL, Riak, etc. These two
interfaces allow the Laravel authentication mechanisms to continue
functioning regardless of how the user data is stored or what type of
class is used to represent it.

Let's take a look at the ``UserProvider`` contract:

::

    interface UserProvider {

        public function retrieveById($identifier);
        public function retrieveByToken($identifier, $token);
        public function updateRememberToken(Authenticatable $user, $token);
        public function retrieveByCredentials(array $credentials);
        public function validateCredentials(Authenticatable $user, array $credentials);

    }

The ``retrieveById`` function typically receives a numeric key
representing the user, such as an auto-incrementing ID from a MySQL
database. The ``Authenticatable`` implementation matching the ID should
be retrieved and returned by the method.

The ``retrieveByToken`` function retrieves a user by their unique
``$identifier`` and "remember me" ``$token``, stored in a field
``remember_token``. As with with previous method, the
``Authenticatable`` implementation should be returned.

The ``updateRememberToken`` method updates the ``$user`` field
``remember_token`` with the new ``$token``. The new token can be either
a fresh token, assigned on successfull "remember me" login attempt, or a
null when user is logged out.

The ``retrieveByCredentials`` method receives the array of credentials
passed to the ``Auth::attempt`` method when attempting to sign into an
application. The method should then "query" the underlying persistent
storage for the user matching those credentials. Typically, this method
will run a query with a "where" condition on
``$credentials['username']``. **This method should not attempt to do any
password validation or authentication.**

The ``validateCredentials`` method should compare the given ``$user``
with the ``$credentials`` to authenticate the user. For example, this
method might compare the ``$user->getAuthPassword()`` string to a
``Hash::make`` of ``$credentials['password']``.

Now that we have explored each of the methods on the ``UserProvider``,
let's take a look at the ``Authenticatable``. Remember, the provider
should return implementations of this interface from the
``retrieveById`` and ``retrieveByCredentials`` methods:

::

    interface Authenticatable {

        public function getAuthIdentifier();
        public function getAuthPassword();
        public function getRememberToken();
        public function setRememberToken($value);
        public function getRememberTokenName();

    }

This interface is simple. The ``getAuthIdentifier`` method should return
the "primary key" of the user. In a MySQL back-end, again, this would be
the auto-incrementing primary key. The ``getAuthPassword`` should return
the user's hashed password. This interface allows the authentication
system to work with any User class, regardless of what ORM or storage
abstraction layer you are using. By default, Laravel includes a ``User``
class in the ``app`` directory which implements this interface, so you
may consult this class for an implementation example.

Finally, once we have implemented the ``UserProvider``, we are ready to
register our extension with the ``Auth`` facade:

::

    Auth::extend('riak', function($app)
    {
        return new RiakUserProvider($app['riak.connection']);
    });

After you have registered the driver with the ``extend`` method, you
switch to the new driver in your ``config/auth.php`` configuration file.

 ## IoC Based Extension

Almost every service provider included with the Laravel framework binds
objects into the IoC container. You can find a list of your
application's service providers in the ``config/app.php`` configuration
file. As you have time, you should skim through each of these provider's
source code. By doing so, you will gain a much better understanding of
what each provider adds to the framework, as well as what keys are used
to bind various services into the IoC container.

For example, the ``HashServiceProvider`` binds a ``hash`` key into the
IoC container, which resolves into a ``Illuminate\Hashing\BcryptHasher``
instance. You can easily extend and override this class within your own
application by overriding this IoC binding. For example:

::

    <?php namespace App\Providers;

    class SnappyHashProvider extends \Illuminate\Hashing\HashServiceProvider {

        public function boot()
        {
            $this->app->bindShared('hash', function()
            {
                return new \Snappy\Hashing\ScryptHasher;
            });

            parent::boot();
        }

    }

Note that this class extends the ``HashServiceProvider``, not the
default ``ServiceProvider`` base class. Once you have extended the
service provider, swap out the ``HashServiceProvider`` in your
``config/app.php`` configuration file with the name of your extended
provider.

This is the general method of extending any core class that is bound in
the container. Essentially every core class is bound in the container in
this fashion, and can be overridden. Again, reading through the included
framework service providers will familiarize you with where various
classes are bound into the container, and what keys they are bound by.
This is a great way to learn more about how Laravel is put together.
