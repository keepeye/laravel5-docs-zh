 ## Configuration

The Laravel Queue component provides a unified API across a variety of
different queue services. Queues allow you to defer the processing of a
time consuming task, such as sending an e-mail, until a later time, thus
drastically speeding up the web requests to your application.

The queue configuration file is stored in ``config/queue.php``. In this
file you will find connection configurations for each of the queue
drivers that are included with the framework, which includes a database,
`Beanstalkd <http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd>`__,
`IronMQ <http://iron.io>`__, `Amazon SQS <http://aws.amazon.com/sqs>`__,
`Redis <http://redis.io>`__, null, and synchronous (for local use)
driver. The ``null`` queue driver simply discards queued jobs so they
are never run.

Queue Database Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the ``database`` queue driver, you will need a database
table to hold the jobs. To generate a migration to create this table,
run the ``queue:table`` Artisan command:

::

    php artisan queue:table

Other Queue Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following dependencies are needed for the listed queue drivers:

-  Amazon SQS: ``aws/aws-sdk-php``
-  Beanstalkd: ``pda/pheanstalk ~3.0``
-  IronMQ: ``iron-io/iron_mq``
-  Redis: ``predis/predis ~1.0``

 ## Basic Usage

Pushing A Job Onto The Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the queueable jobs for your application are stored in the
``App\Commands`` directory. You may generate a new queued command using
the Artisan CLI:

::

    php artisan make:command SendEmail --queued

To push a new job onto the queue, use the ``Queue::push`` method:

::

    Queue::push(new SendEmail($message));

    **Note:** In this example, we are using the ``Queue`` facade
    directly; however, typically you would dispatch queued command via
    the `Command Bus </docs/5.0/bus>`__. We will continue to use the
    ``Queue`` facade throughout this page; however, familiarize with the
    command bus as well, since it is used to dispatch both queued and
    synchronous commands for your application.

By default, the ``make:command`` Artisan command generates a
"self-handling" command, meaning a ``handle`` method is added to the
command itself. This method will be called when the job is executed by
the queue. You may type-hint any dependencies you need on the ``handle``
method and the `IoC container </docs/5.0/container>`__ will
automatically inject them:

::

    public function handle(UserRepository $users)
    {
        //
    }

If you would like your command to have a separate handler class, you
should add the ``--handler`` flag to the ``make:command`` command:

::

    php artisan make:command SendEmail --queued --handler

The generated handler will be placed in ``App\Handlers\Commands`` and
will be resolved out of the IoC container.

Specifying The Queue / Tube For A Job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also specify the queue / tube a job should be sent to:

::

    Queue::pushOn('emails', new SendEmail($message));

Passing The Same Payload To Multiple Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to pass the same data to several queue jobs, you may use the
``Queue::bulk`` method:

::

    Queue::bulk(array(new SendEmail($message), new AnotherCommand));

Delaying The Execution Of A Job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you may wish to delay the execution of a queued job. For
instance, you may wish to queue a job that sends a customer an e-mail 15
minutes after sign-up. You can accomplish this using the
``Queue::later`` method:

::

    $date = Carbon::now()->addMinutes(15);

    Queue::later($date, new SendEmail($message));

In this example, we're using the
`Carbon <https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon>`__ date library to
specify the delay we wish to assign to the job. Alternatively, you may
pass the number of seconds you wish to delay as an integer.

    **Note:** The Amazon SQS service has a delay limit of 900 seconds
    (15 minutes).

Queues And Eloquent Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your queued job accepts an Eloquent model in its constructor, only
the identifier for the model will be serialized onto the queue. When the
job is actually handled, the queue system will automatically re-retrieve
the full model instance from the database. It's all totally transparent
to your application and prevents issues that can arise from serializing
full Eloquent model instances.

Deleting A Processed Job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have processed a job, it must be deleted from the queue. If no
exception is thrown during the execution of your job, this will be done
automatically.

If you would like to ``delete`` or ``release`` the job manually, the
``Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue`` trait provides access to the
queue job ``release`` and ``delete`` methods. The ``release`` method
accepts a single value: the number of seconds you wish to wait until the
job is made available again.

::

    public function handle(SendEmail $command)
    {
        if (true)
        {
            $this->release(30);
        }
    }

Releasing A Job Back Onto The Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IF an exception is thrown while the job is being processed, it will
automatically be released back onto the queue so it may be attempted
again. The job will continue to be released until it has been attempted
the maximum number of times allowed by your application. The number of
maximum attempts is defined by the ``--tries`` switch used on the
``queue:listen`` or ``queue:work`` Artisan commands.

Checking The Number Of Run Attempts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an exception occurs while the job is being processed, it will
automatically be released back onto the queue. You may check the number
of attempts that have been made to run the job using the ``attempts``
method:

::

    if ($this->attempts() > 3)
    {
        //
    }

    **Note:** Your command / handler must use the
    ``Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue`` trait in order to call this
    method.

 ## Queueing Closures

You may also push a Closure onto the queue. This is very convenient for
quick, simple tasks that need to be queued:

Pushing A Closure Onto The Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    Queue::push(function($job) use ($id)
    {
        Account::delete($id);

        $job->delete();
    });

    **Note:** Instead of making objects available to queued Closures via
    the ``use`` directive, consider passing primary keys and re-pulling
    the associated models from within your queue job. This often avoids
    unexpected serialization behavior.

When using Iron.io `push queues <#push-queues>`__, you should take extra
precaution queueing Closures. The end-point that receives your queue
messages should check for a token to verify that the request is actually
from Iron.io. For example, your push queue end-point should be something
like: ``https://yourapp.com/queue/receive?token=SecretToken``. You may
then check the value of the secret token in your application before
marshalling the queue request.

 ## Running The Queue Listener

Laravel includes an Artisan task that will run new jobs as they are
pushed onto the queue. You may run this task using the ``queue:listen``
command:

Starting The Queue Listener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    php artisan queue:listen

You may also specify which queue connection the listener should utilize:

::

    php artisan queue:listen connection

Note that once this task has started, it will continue to run until it
is manually stopped. You may use a process monitor such as
`Supervisor <http://supervisord.org/>`__ to ensure that the queue
listener does not stop running.

You may pass a comma-delimited list of queue connections to the
``listen`` command to set queue priorities:

::

    php artisan queue:listen --queue=high,low

In this example, jobs on the ``high-connection`` will always be
processed before moving onto jobs from the ``low-connection``.

Specifying The Job Timeout Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also set the length of time (in seconds) each job should be
allowed to run:

::

    php artisan queue:listen --timeout=60

Specifying Queue Sleep Duration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition, you may specify the number of seconds to wait before
polling for new jobs:

::

    php artisan queue:listen --sleep=5

Note that the queue only "sleeps" if no jobs are on the queue. If more
jobs are available, the queue will continue to work them without
sleeping.

Processing The First Job On The Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To process only the first job on the queue, you may use the
``queue:work`` command:

::

    php artisan queue:work

 ## Daemon Queue Worker

The ``queue:work`` also includes a ``--daemon`` option for forcing the
queue worker to continue processing jobs without ever re-booting the
framework. This results in a significant reduction of CPU usage when
compared to the ``queue:listen`` command, but at the added complexity of
needing to drain the queues of currently executing jobs during your
deployments.

To start a queue worker in daemon mode, use the ``--daemon`` flag:

::

    php artisan queue:work connection --daemon

    php artisan queue:work connection --daemon --sleep=3

    php artisan queue:work connection --daemon --sleep=3 --tries=3

As you can see, the ``queue:work`` command supports most of the same
options available to ``queue:listen``. You may use the
``php artisan help queue:work`` command to view all of the available
options.

Deploying With Daemon Queue Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to deploy an application using daemon queue workers is
to put the application in maintenance mode at the beginning of your
deployment. This can be done using the ``php artisan down`` command.
Once the application is in maintenance mode, Laravel will not accept any
new jobs off of the queue, but will continue to process existing jobs.

The easiest way to restart your workers is to include the following
command in your deployment script:

::

    php artisan queue:restart

This command will instruct all queue workers to restart after they
finish processing their current job.

    **Note:** This command relies on the cache system to schedule the
    restart. By default, APCu does not work for CLI commands. If you are
    using APCu, add ``apc.enable_cli=1`` to your APCu configuration.

Coding For Daemon Queue Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Daemon queue workers do not restart the framework before processing each
job. Therefore, you should be careful to free any heavy resources before
your job finishes. For example, if you are doing image manipulation with
the GD library, you should free the memory with ``imagedestroy`` when
you are done.

Similarly, your database connection may disconnect when being used by
long-running daemon. You may use the ``DB::reconnect`` method to ensure
you have a fresh connection.

 ## Push Queues

Push queues allow you to utilize the powerful Laravel 4 queue facilities
without running any daemons or background listeners. Currently, push
queues are only supported by the `Iron.io <http://iron.io>`__ driver.
Before getting started, create an Iron.io account, and add your Iron
credentials to the ``config/queue.php`` configuration file.

Registering A Push Queue Subscriber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you may use the ``queue:subscribe`` Artisan command to register a
URL end-point that will receive newly pushed queue jobs:

::

    php artisan queue:subscribe queue_name http://foo.com/queue/receive

Now, when you login to your Iron dashboard, you will see your new push
queue, as well as the subscribed URL. You may subscribe as many URLs as
you wish to a given queue. Next, create a route for your
``queue/receive`` end-point and return the response from the
``Queue::marshal`` method:

::

    Route::post('queue/receive', function()
    {
        return Queue::marshal();
    });

The ``marshal`` method will take care of firing the correct job handler
class. To fire jobs onto the push queue, just use the same
``Queue::push`` method used for conventional queues.

 ## Failed Jobs

Since things don't always go as planned, sometimes your queued jobs will
fail. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us! Laravel includes a
convenient way to specify the maximum number of times a job should be
attempted. After a job has exceeded this amount of attempts, it will be
inserted into a ``failed_jobs`` table. The failed jobs table name can be
configured via the ``config/queue.php`` configuration file.

To create a migration for the ``failed_jobs`` table, you may use the
``queue:failed-table`` command:

::

    php artisan queue:failed-table

You can specify the maximum number of times a job should be attempted
using the ``--tries`` switch on the ``queue:listen`` command:

::

    php artisan queue:listen connection-name --tries=3

If you would like to register an event that will be called when a queue
job fails, you may use the ``Queue::failing`` method. This event is a
great opportunity to notify your team via e-mail or
`HipChat <https://www.hipchat.com>`__.

::

    Queue::failing(function($connection, $job, $data)
    {
        //
    });

You may also define a ``failed`` method directly on a queue job class,
allowing you to perform job specific actions when a failure occurs:

::

    public function failed()
    {
        // Called when the job is failing...
    }

Retrying Failed Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view all of your failed jobs, you may use the ``queue:failed``
Artisan command:

::

    php artisan queue:failed

The ``queue:failed`` command will list the job ID, connection, queue,
and failure time. The job ID may be used to retry the failed job. For
instance, to retry a failed job that has an ID of 5, the following
command should be issued:

::

    php artisan queue:retry 5

If you would like to delete a failed job, you may use the
``queue:forget`` command:

::

    php artisan queue:forget 5

To delete all of your failed jobs, you may use the ``queue:flush``
command:

::

    php artisan queue:flush
