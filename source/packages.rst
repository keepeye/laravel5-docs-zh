 ## Introduction

Packages are the primary way of adding functionality to Laravel.
Packages might be anything from a great way to work with dates like
`Carbon <https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon>`__, or an entire BDD
testing framework like `Behat <https://github.com/Behat/Behat>`__.

Of course, there are different types of packages. Some packages are
stand-alone, meaning they work with any framework, not just Laravel.
Both Carbon and Behat are examples of stand-alone packages. Any of these
packages may be used with Laravel by simply requesting them in your
``composer.json`` file.

On the other hand, other packages are specifically intended for use with
Laravel. These packages may have routes, controllers, views, and
configuration specifically intended to enhance a Laravel application.
This guide primarily covers the development of those that are Laravel
specific.

All Laravel packages are distributed via
`Packagist <http://packagist.org>`__ and
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`__, so learning about these wonderful
PHP package distribution tools is essential.

 ## Views

Your package's internal structure is entirely up to you; however,
typically each package will contain one or more `service
providers </docs/5.0/providers>`__. The service provider contains any
`IoC </docs/5.0/container>`__ bindings, as well as instructions as to
where package configuration, views, and translation files are located.

Views
~~~~~

Package views are typically referenced using a double-colon "namespace"
syntax:

::

    return view('package::view.name');

All you need to do is tell Laravel where the views for a given namespace
are located. For example, if your package is named "courier", you might
add the following to your service provider's ``boot`` method:

::

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->loadViewsFrom(__DIR__.'/path/to/views', 'courier');
    }

Now you may load your package views using the following syntax:

::

    return view('courier::view.name');

When you use the ``loadViewsFrom`` method, Laravel actually registers
**two** locations for your views: one in the application's
``resources/views/vendor`` directory and one in the directory you
specify. So, using our ``courier`` example: when requesting a package
view, Laravel will first check if a custom version of the view has been
provided by the developer in ``resources/views/vendor/courier``. Then,
if the view has not been customized, Laravel will search the package
view directory you specified in your call to ``loadViewsFrom``. This
makes it easy for end-users to customize / override your package's
views.

Publishing Views
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To publish your package's views to the ``resources/views/vendor``
directory, you should use the ``publishes`` method from the ``boot``
method of your service provider:

::

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->loadViewsFrom(__DIR__.'/path/to/views', 'courier');

        $this->publishes([
            __DIR__.'/path/to/views' => base_path('resources/views/vendor/courier'),
        ]);
    }

Now, when users of your package execute Laravel's ``vendor:publish``
command, your views directory will be copied to the specified location.

If you would like to overwrite existing files, use the ``--force``
switch:

::

    php artisan vendor:publish --force

    **Note:** You may use the ``publishes`` method to publish **any**
    type of file to any location you wish.

 ## Translations

Package translation files are typically referenced using a double-colon
syntax:

::

    return trans('package::file.line');

All you need to do is tell Laravel where the translations for a given
namespace are located. For example, if your package is named "courier",
you might add the following to your service provider's ``boot`` method:

::

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->loadTranslationsFrom(__DIR__.'/path/to/translations', 'courier');
    }

Note that within your ``translations`` folder, you would have further
directories for each language, such as ``en``, ``es``, ``ru``, etc.

Now you may load your package translations using the following syntax:

::

    return trans('courier::file.line');

 ## Configuration

Typically, you will want to publish your package's configuration file to
the application's own ``config`` directory. This will allow users of
your package to easily override your default configuration options.

To publish a configuration file, just use the ``publishes`` method from
the ``boot`` method of your service provider:

::

    $this->publishes([
        __DIR__.'/path/to/config/courier.php' => config_path('courier.php'),
    ]);

Now, when users of your package execute Laravel's ``vendor:publish``
command, your file will be copied to the specified location. Of course,
once your configuration has been published, it can be accessed like any
other configuration file:

::

    $value = config('courier.option');

You may also choose to merge your own package configuration file with
the application's copy. This allows your users to include only the
options they actually want to override in the published copy of the
configuration. To merge the configurations, use the ``mergeConfigFrom``
method within your service provider's ``register`` method:

::

    $this->mergeConfigFrom(
        __DIR__.'/path/to/config/courier.php', 'courier'
    );

 ## Publishing File Groups

You may want to publish groups of files separately. For instance, you
might want your users to be able to publish your package's configuration
files and asset files separately. You can do this by 'tagging' them:

::

    // Publish a config file
    $this->publishes([
        __DIR__.'/../config/package.php', config_path('package.php')
    ], 'config');

    // Publish your migrations
    $this->publishes([
        __DIR__.'/../database/migrations/' => base_path('/database/migrations')
    ], 'migrations');

You can then publish these files separately by referencing their tag
like so:

::

    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Vendor\Providers\PackageServiceProvider" --tag="config"

 ## Routing

To load a routes file for your package, simply ``include`` it from
within your service provider's ``boot`` method.

Including A Routes File From A Service Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    public function boot()
    {
        include __DIR__.'/../../routes.php';
    }

    **Note:** If your package is using controllers, you will need to
    make sure they are properly configured in your ``composer.json``
    file's auto-load section.
