 ## Introduction

The ``Illuminate\Support\Collection`` class provides a fluent,
convenient wrapper for working with arrays of data. For example, check
out the following code. We'll use the ``collect`` helper to create a new
collection instance from the array:

::

    $collection = collect(['taylor', 'abigail', null])->map(function($name)
    {
        return strtoupper($name);
    })
    ->reject(function($name)
    {
        return is_null($value);
    });

As you can see, the ``Collection`` class allows you to chain its methods
to perform fluent mapping and reducing of the underlying array. In
general, every ``Collection`` method returns an entirely new
``Collection`` instance. To dig in further, keep reading!

 ## Basic Usage

Creating Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above, the ``collect`` helper will return a new
``Illuminate\Support\Collection`` instance for the given array. You may
also use the ``make`` command on the ``Collection`` class:

::

    $collection = collect([1, 2, 3]);

    $collection = Collection::make([1, 2, 3]);

Of course, collections of `Eloquent </docs/5.0/eloquent>`__ objects are
always returned as ``Collection`` instances; however, you should feel
free to use the ``Collection`` class wherever it is convenient for your
application.
