 ## Introduction

Migrations are a type of version control for your database. They allow a
team to modify the database schema and stay up to date on the current
schema state. Migrations are typically paired with the `Schema
Builder </docs/5.0/schema>`__ to easily manage your application's
schema.

 ## Creating Migrations

To create a migration, you may use the ``make:migration`` command on the
Artisan CLI:

::

    php artisan make:migration create_users_table

The migration will be placed in your ``database/migrations`` folder, and
will contain a timestamp which allows the framework to determine the
order of the migrations.

The ``--table`` and ``--create`` options may also be used to indicate
the name of the table, and whether the migration will be creating a new
table:

::

    php artisan make:migration add_votes_to_user_table --table=users

    php artisan make:migration create_users_table --create=users

 ## Running Migrations

Running All Outstanding Migrations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    php artisan migrate

    **Note:** If you receive a "class not found" error when running
    migrations, try running the ``composer dump-autoload`` command.

Forcing Migrations In Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some migration operations are destructive, meaning they may cause you to
lose data. In order to protect you from running these commands against
your production database, you will prompted for confirmation before
these commands are executed. To force the commands to run without a
prompt, use the ``--force`` flag:

::

    php artisan migrate --force

 ## Rolling Back Migrations

Rollback The Last Migration Operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    php artisan migrate:rollback

Rollback all migrations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    php artisan migrate:reset

Rollback all migrations and run them all again
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    php artisan migrate:refresh

    php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

 ## Database Seeding

Laravel also includes a simple way to seed your database with test data
using seed classes. All seed classes are stored in ``database/seeds``.
Seed classes may have any name you wish, but probably should follow some
sensible convention, such as ``UserTableSeeder``, etc. By default, a
``DatabaseSeeder`` class is defined for you. From this class, you may
use the ``call`` method to run other seed classes, allowing you to
control the seeding order.

Example Database Seed Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder {

        public function run()
        {
            $this->call('UserTableSeeder');

            $this->command->info('User table seeded!');
        }

    }

    class UserTableSeeder extends Seeder {

        public function run()
        {
            DB::table('users')->delete();

            User::create(array('email' => 'foo@bar.com'));
        }

    }

To seed your database, you may use the ``db:seed`` command on the
Artisan CLI:

::

    php artisan db:seed

By default, the ``db:seed`` command runs the ``DatabaseSeeder`` class,
which may be used to call other seed classes. However, you may use the
``--class`` option to specify a specific seeder class to run
individually:

::

    php artisan db:seed --class=UserTableSeeder

You may also seed your database using the ``migrate:refresh`` command,
which will also rollback and re-run all of your migrations:

::

    php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
