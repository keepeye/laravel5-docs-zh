 ## Configuration

In other frameworks, pagination can be very painful. Laravel makes it a
breeze. Laravel can generate an intelligent "range" of links based on
the current page. The generated HTML is compatible with the Bootstrap
CSS framework.

 ## Usage

There are several ways to paginate items. The simplest is by using the
``paginate`` method on the query builder or an Eloquent model.

Paginating Database Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $users = DB::table('users')->paginate(15);

    **Note:** Currently, pagination operations that use a ``groupBy``
    statement cannot be executed efficiently by Laravel. If you need to
    use a ``groupBy`` with a paginated result set, it is recommended
    that you query the database and create a paginator manually.

Creating A Paginator Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you may wish to create a pagination instance manually, passing
it an array of items. You may do so by creating either an
``Illuminate\Pagination\Paginator`` or
``Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator`` instance, depending on
your needs.

Paginating An Eloquent Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also paginate `Eloquent </docs/5.0/eloquent>`__ models:

::

    $allUsers = User::paginate(15);

    $someUsers = User::where('votes', '>', 100)->paginate(15);

The argument passed to the ``paginate`` method is the number of items
you wish to display per page. Once you have retrieved the results, you
may display them on your view, and create the pagination links using the
``render`` method:

::

    <div class="container">
        <?php foreach ($users as $user): ?>
            <?php echo $user->name; ?>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    </div>

    <?php echo $users->render(); ?>

This is all it takes to create a pagination system! Note that we did not
have to inform the framework of the current page. Laravel will determine
this for you automatically.

You may also access additional pagination information via the following
methods:

-  ``currentPage``
-  ``lastPage``
-  ``perPage``
-  ``total``
-  ``count``

"Simple Pagination"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are only showing "Next" and "Previous" links in your pagination
view, you have the option of using the ``simplePaginate`` method to
perform a more efficient query. This is useful for larger datasets when
you do not require the display of exact page numbers on your view:

::

    $someUsers = User::where('votes', '>', 100)->simplePaginate(15);

Customizing The Paginator URI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also customize the URI used by the paginator via the ``setPath``
method:

::

    $users = User::paginate();

    $users->setPath('custom/url');

The example above will create URLs like the following:
http://example.com/custom/url?page=2

 ## Appending To Pagination Links

You can add to the query string of pagination links using the
``appends`` method on the Paginator:

::

    <?php echo $users->appends(['sort' => 'votes'])->render(); ?>

This will generate URLs that look something like this:

::

    http://example.com/something?page=2&sort=votes

If you wish to append a "hash fragment" to the paginator's URLs, you may
use the ``fragment`` method:

::

    <?php echo $users->fragment('foo')->render(); ?>

This method call will generate URLs that look something like this:

::

    http://example.com/something?page=2#foo

 ## Converting To JSON

The ``Paginator`` class implements the
``Illuminate\Contracts\Support\JsonableInterface`` contract and exposes
the ``toJson`` method. You may also convert a ``Paginator`` instance to
JSON by returning it from a route. The JSON'd form of the instance will
include some "meta" information such as ``total``, ``current_page``, and
``last_page``. The instance's data will be available via the ``data``
key in the JSON array.
